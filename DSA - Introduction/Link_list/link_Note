    Linked List
    Types of Linked List
    Demo - Partially completed
Summary 
Walkthrough of the Materials

List :- 
=> It is a collection of similar items.
set is actually a type of list !

Link = Connection
Link List has 3 link type 

1) Singley Linked List:-
    => The items are connected to each other 
    => Every item has 2 parts namely:
        1. value
        2. next :- 
            here you will find the connection of the next value/pointer/address of next value / etc...
    => The last item's pointer will be pointing towards null
    => Linear shaped data structure. one way connection
    => The first item is called as head.
    => The las item is called as tail.
    => The total number of items are called as size.
    => Here each node is connected with just one node


2) Doubly Links List:-
    => Each Node will be connected with two nodes.
    => Every item has 3 parts namely
        1. value
        2. next:-
            here you will find the connection to the next value/pointer/address if next value/ etc..,
        3. prev:- 
            here you will find the connection to the previous value/pointer/address of next value/ etc..,
    => The last item's next pointer will be pointing towards null and also the first item's previous pointer will be pointing towards null .
    => Linear shaped data strucute - Two way connection.
    => The first item is called as head.
    => The las item is called as tail.
    => The total number of items are called as size.
    

3) Circular Linked List
    => The last node will be connected to the first node and hence it forms a closed loop like circle.
    => This concept can be implemented on both singly linkes list and doubly link list 
    => This concept can be implemented on both singley and doubley link list 

Important Points
    => Since the nodes are accessed sequentially, if the linked list is huge then it will take some time to access a node.
    => Since the nodes are storing the address, if the linked list is huge then it will take lot of memory.


Demo - Execute some javascript programs 
2. approaches
    1. Use Browser to execute JS programs
        In chrome Browser - JS compiler - V8 Engine
        In Microsoft Edge - chakra Engine
        In Firefox - Spider Monkey
    2. Use Nodejs to execute JS programs 
        In Nodejs Server - JS compiler - Made of 8 Engine.
